Socialmath Week 7:

Our new domain name: www.socmat.com
(The knowledge graph display contains bugs that will be fixed soon.)
This week has been pretty productive. We made successful merge between our
django framework with our angular/d3 js visualization and front-end features. 
Also, as the full user profile service is up, everyone can make contributions
to the knowledge graph, and follow the theorems/articles they are interested. 
Also, the search feature bugs are fixed as well. 

Over the past week:
  Jianchi: Fully implement user profile features, "follow" feature, and fixed
           user registration glitches. Now everyone can register can make
           contributions to our knowledge graph. Wrote models for private 
           graph, but not ready for deployment yet. Also the www.socmat.com
           domain name. 
  Kexin: Worked to merge the our js visualization tools with the django
         framework. Made sure everything works on AWS. 
  Ying-Yu: Made a buggy partial display of knowledge graph. 

Upcoming goals for the week:
  Jianchi: Fully implement private graph feature. Finish up!
  Kexin:  Work on private graph and poster. Meanwhile, make 
          sure that we will still have a working demo at the 
          presentation after deploying new features 
  Ying-Yu: Debug. Implement graphic editing tool.
  All: Poster!
