Socialmath week 5:

Over the past week, we have been focusing on putting a simple working version of our
product online. On one hand, we have been trying to connect Ying-yu's front end 
visualization with back end database. On the other hand, we have started to set up
Amazon EC2 (Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud) to host the website. We were able to make
progress on both sides, but there are still work to be done.

Meanwhile, we have also been extending the website's functionalities. Jianchi has
been working on the user authentication system. We are hoping to enable users to
set up a private knowledge graph that is only accessible by, for example, students
in a class.

The website is now available at: http://socialmath-env.elasticbeanstalk.com/prooftree/
The website has been seeded with number theory theorems. Currently, the visualiztion is  unavailable.

Over the past week:
  Jianchi:  Finished user register-login-authorization coding. 
  Kexin: Worked with Ying-yu to help merge his visualization. Set up AWS. 
  Ying-Yu: Let visualization part take data from server side.
  Tim: Nothing.

Upcoming goals for the week:
    Jianchi: Implement user-profile system and other user functionalities (change 
      password, etc.) Start implementing "private graph" system. Start migrating
      new database models into the online database.
    Kexin: Solved the remaining configuration issues with AWS, e.g. fix the broken
      stylesheets. Help Jianchi with database migration problems.
    Ying-Yu: Integrate show detail, add, delete functions with visualization.
    Tim: Work on private graph system to enable smaller groups of users to maintain
      their own individual proof trees.
