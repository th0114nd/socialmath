Socialmath week 3:

We implemented a full working set of basic methods and templates running in the
backend, enabling users to add, delete, and modify theorems and proofs in the
system. We have also implemented automated tests that will accelerate our
debugging and development process.

We are planning to:
  1). Work on improving the current user interface and the error
      handling system to have a good robust basic system that can be demonstrated
      and used; 
  2). Finish develping the automated visualization system that can layout the graph
      structure clearly and beautifully;
  3). Start working on user-profile and authorization system, including design and
      implementations

Over the pasts week:
  Jianchi: Wrote the view templates and view methods that enable users to edit
    existing theorems and proofs, in addition to new theorem/proof submissions. 
  Tim: 
  Kexin:
  Ying-Yu: Tweaking hierarchical force layout algorithm for proof graph
    (like handling collision between boxes).

Upcoming goals for the week:
    Jianchi: Complete template and basic backend system, including interface, 
      error handling and reporting, edge cases consideration, etc. Start
      implementing user-profile system. 
    Kexin:
    Tim:
    Ying-Yu: Finish layout algorithm and integrate it into existing templates.
