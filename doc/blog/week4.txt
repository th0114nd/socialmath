Socialmath week 4:

This week, we implemented the keyword-adding/modifying, and searching
functionalities. Now a search bar will be displayed at the index page, and
the search is based on the keywords linked to theorems and articles.
The theorem/article submission now supports LaTex code and can display
mathematical equations correctly using MathJax, a free online
LaTex compiling tool.
On the visualization part, Ying-yu has made substantial progress to
set up the layout of the knowledge graph. We are now expecting a
website-visualization merge.
In addition, the stylesheet of the website is written so it looks much
prettier now!

Over the past week:
  Jianchi: Modified view functions and completed back-end basic implementation.
    Cleared submission bugs and enabled detail-view to display dependencies,
    theorem-proof relationships. User Interface adjustments. 
  Tim: 
  Kexin: Seeded database with number theory examples. Worked on front end
    CSS and support for LaTex on the webpage.
  Ying-Yu: Made a working graphical layout for knowledge graph. Studied 
    different components provided by UI Bootstrap.

Merging the javascript visualization code with the current backend-database
construct Jianchi and Kexin has set up will be the biggest goal next week.
Kexin will also be working on putting the website on the Amazon EC2 server.
Meanwhile, Jianchi will try to implement the user-authentication and profile
system, to make the website more complete.

Upcoming goals for the week:
    Jianchi: User-profile system implementation. Error
      handling also needs to be added (e.g. blank titles, invalid Latex code).
    Kexin: Work with Ying-yu for potential issues on the communication between
      graph layout and the back end. Start implementing user profile related
      feature. 
    Ying-Yu: Improve graph layout to make it less messy. Find a way to display
      main content of submission. Work with Kexin to connent my front-end
      to the back-end.
