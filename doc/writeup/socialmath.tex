\subsection*{Abstract}
A mathematical proof has the structure of a DAG. However, it is typically
presented in a linear fashion, and cannot practically expose the depth of its
roots. We propose a web service to provide both of these by exposing part of
the graph to the user and allowing them to explore down into the subproofs.
Naturally it would be prohibitive for the authors to write even a useful amount
of the tree in, so the service allows the introduction of new proofs to expand
the reach of the proof trees. Specification of proofs could either be very
formal, in which case a program could verify them or more relaxed and reviewed
by other users in a social effort to find mathematical truth.

\section{Introduction}
We propose a web application that allows the inspection of, addition to, and
potentially input of verification of collection of large proof DAGs.
Interfacing with a node of the tree will present a statement of the theorem
associated with that node, edges to the children and potentially to some of its
parents. Text accompanies the node, and explains how the children are combined
together to prove the theorem. Ideally the accompanying text is as small as
possible and the nodes have a small fan out to break the proof down into
digestible chunks.

We have two possible choices to proceed on how to keep the DAG logically sound.
The first is more of a technical problem: require highly precise statements of
additions to the tree to be parsed, the logical statements can then be verified
(or rejected) automatically. Alternatively, with a more social emphasis proofs
could be stated in natural mathematical language. Under this scheme, the
correctness would have to be verified by users, through a combination
of moderation, reputation, and democracy.

\section{Technical Hurdles}
At the very basic level we have to deal with all the usual problems in
building a webapp: deciding upon tools (languages, databases, frameworks)
and an API to communicate between client and server. Further features
needed would be dynamic loading of the graph as the user scrolls through,
search to look for other proofs to minimize redundancy, automated theorem
verification or a voting mechanism, ability to mention other theorems
to include them is lemmas in a particular proof, text entry for a theorem,
inclusion of images for proofs that necessitate it, and collections of
axioms for the various fields of mathematics that could be present as
a starting point. Hard problems would involve the choice of data 
structure for the proofs, intuitive presentation of the DAG to the user,
an effective mechanism of rejecting poorly worded or incorrect proofs.

\section{Potential Order of Implementation}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Persistent storage of a proof in the database.
    \item Communication of a proof over the network.
    \item User interface.
    \item Adding a new theorem from the user interface.
    \item Persistence of theorems in UI across page loads.
    \item Verification system (social or formal). 
\end{enumerate}

\section{Background}
I'm not aware of any similar projects.

\section{Timeline}
\subsection{Initial Timeline}
Below is the initial project timeline we proposed at the project proposal presentation. The plan was to build a working prototype before midterm, and to add as many features as time allows afterwards.  
\begin{itemize}
\item Week 2 - 5: Basics
\begin{itemize}
\item Client-server API
\item Database API
\item Implement views and templates for browsing, editing, and adding theorems
\item Front end visualization
\end{itemize}
\item Week 6: Milestone:\\
Should have a simple working prototype, which allows adding, deleting and viewing nodes from the proof DAG
\item Week 7 - 9: Useful advanced features
\begin{itemize}
\item Search by keywords
\item User profile
\item private graph
\item Auto-keyword-extraction
\item Suggested theorems
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Actual Timeline}
Below is a summary of our actual weekly progress based on the blogs. We underestimated the amount of front end work needed in the project. However, we were able to implement the three most useful advanced features: keyword search, user profile and private graph. A detail description of the end product is given in the next section.
\begin{enumerate}
\item \emph{Week 1:  Changing Gears}\\\\
Due to the discovery of a fairly comprehensive open source traffic simulator project, we decided to abandon the original project proposal and to work, instead, on a web app to accommodate the visualization of mathematical proof tree structures. We discussed the basic application architecture: the typical LAMP stack with a REST API and CRUD functionality. In our case the P stands for Python, the M stands for SQLite, and the A could either be Apache or AWS. On the backend we're running Django to setup the structure of the site, and on the front end we're using d3.js for visualization, AngularJS for DOM manipulation, as well as Bootstrap for templates and style. That is of course if there is enough orthogonality between the web frameworks for them to play nicely together.\\\\
The first steps we took were similar to any team making a CRUD app: setting up the database and a method of communication between the client and server. Specifically, we determined a schema for the database and fleshed out data structures for the DAG. We also started to familiarized ourselves with the frameworks that we will be working with for the rest of the term.\\\\

\item \emph{Week 2: Getting Started }\\\\
This week the first draft of the API was written. It's a fairly
standard one that supports the collection of all entries in
a paginated manner, getting a single entry for a close up view,
and the CRUD operations expected to have. \\\\
On the server side, we've decided to go for AWS instead of Apache. As a result, we switched to using virtualenv, which gave us consistent versioning across our local machines as well as allowing us to use versions required by AWS without having conflicts of the development computers. We also migrated from SQLite to MySQL, since AWS had the best support for the latter. Although setting up MySQL was slightly frustrating.\\\\
On the backend side, we implemented serializers to help form json responses, and view methods for creating and reading theorems/proofs .\\\\
On the front end side, we were able to transform the backend proof tree models into D3.js' graph format. We also wrote view templates for corresponding view methods. However, developing an algorithm for automatic hierarchical layout was harder than we had expected.\\

\item \emph{Week 3: Backend Milestone}\\\\
After adding templates and view methods for edit and deletion, we had a fully working set of CRUD functionalities implemented this week. We also did substantial unit tests on database models and api calls to make sure that our backend was robust so far. \\\\
At this point, the backend has already reached the original midterm milestone. In the front end, however, we were still tweaking hierarchical force layout algorithm to handle collisions and overlaps between boxes.\\

\item \emph{Week 4: Moving on}\\\\
This week, the backend side has moved on to advanced features, starting with the keyword related ones. We implemented keyword creation, edit and search. Users can add an arbitrary number of keywords for theorems/proofs, and a search bar was added on the index page to allow search by keywords.\\\\
As we moved one person from the backend to the front end, the front end side has made substantial progress this week. First, we wrote a stylesheet for the website to make it more user friendly. We also set up MathJax, a free online LaTex compiling tool, to support adding and displaying LaTex code on the website. Finally, we had a working dynamic knowledge graph layout algorithm. However, the visualization was working as an independent component, and needed to be merged with the rest of the project.\\\\


\item \emph{Week 5:  MVP online}\\\\
This week, we have been focusing on putting a simple working version of our product online. On one hand, we tried to connect the knowledge graph visualization with backend database. On the other hand, we worked on setting up Amazon EC2 (Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud) to host the website. We were able to seed the database with number theory theorems and deploy the latest backend code. The knowledge graph visualization was still unavailable online at this point. \\\\
Meanwhile, we have also been extending the website's functionalities. We started to implement user authentication system in the hope of enabling users to set up private knowledge graphs for classroom setttings.\\\\


\item \emph{Week 6: }\\



\item \emph{Week 7:  }\\

\item \emph{Week 8: }\\

\end{enumerate}
\section{End Product}
The end product would hopefully be a useful web application that would
allow publishing of proofs in a graphical format subject to immediate review
of other users, and a repository for a large collection of proofs to be
seen in a graphical format upon request.
